SUMMARY:


This library implements basic ...



*EXPONENTIAL FUNCTIONS*

fp32_sqrt: Uses Newton's Method with starting point r/2 on input r.
	   The number of iterations is set as NUM_NEWT_ITER in parameters.h





4. Possible Extensions/Optimizations

>> Put this readme into a latex document

>> For optimization capabilities, include an integer as an argument for which
   computational method to perform, and then make the function into a giant switch
   statement.

   On second thought...macros/global constants will probably be better...
